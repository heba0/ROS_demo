In this project, I run a ROS-Gazebo SLAM simulation and visualize the image on a web-based dashoboard, as well as read data from a dataset that I have in a folder called "Dataset_ECG_1" and 
-I didn't include in the github repo, but you can add a place holder to this path: /dev_ws/src/ecg_data/scripts - and publish
